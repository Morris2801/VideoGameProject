                <h2>Background story</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Mayaztec, a thrilling journey through a mystical pyramid steeped in Aztec and Mayan mythology.
                If you unfourtunatley die, you will keep your most recent card that you picked up and will be able to use it
                in your next life whenever you please. Your goal is to defeat the angry gods that are waiting for you at the end,
                so, will you be the one to break the curse and defeat the gods, or will you be just another victim? Go ahead and start
                playing with your new knowledge, and good luck!
                </p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Its really simple really, you use "WASD" to move press "X" to attack the many enemies you will face,
            "F" to interact with the vases and cards, and use the numbers 1 through 6 to activate the cards you have, 1 being the
            left-most card and 6 being the right-most card.
